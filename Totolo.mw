In everyday use and in [[kinematics]], na '''totolo''' of an object is the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the change of its [[Position (vector)|position]]; it is thus a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Edwin Bidwell|title=Vector analysis: a text-book for the use of students of mathematics and physics, founded upon the lectures of J.

Speed has the [[dimensional analysis|dimension]]s of distance divided by time. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of speed is the [[metre per second]], but the most common unit of speed in everyday usage is the [[kilometre per hour]] or, in the US and the UK, [[miles per hour]]. For air and marine travel the [[Knot (unit)|knot]] is commonly used.

[[File:Mersan.JPG|right|300x300px|thumb|Speed can be thought of as the rate at which an object covers [[distance]]. A fast-moving object has a high speed and covers a relatively large distance in a given amount of time, while a slow-moving object covers a relatively small amount of distance in the same amount of time.]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''divisor''' of an [[integer]] <math>n</math>, also called a '''factor''' of <math>n</math>, is an integer <math>m</math> that may be multiplied by some integer to produce <math>n</math>. In this case, one also says that <math>n</math> is a '''multiple''' of <math>m.</math> An integer <math>n</math> is '''divisible''' by another integer <math>m</math> if <math>m</math> is a divisor of <math>n</math>; this implies dividing <math>n</math> by <math>m</math> leaves no remainder.

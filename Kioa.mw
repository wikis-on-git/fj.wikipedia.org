'''Kioa''' is an [[island]] in [[Fiji]], an outlier to [[Vanua Levu]], one of Fiji's two main islands.  Situated opposite [[Buca Bay]], Kioa was purchased by settlers from [[Vaitupu]] atoll in [[Tuvalu]], who came between 1947 and 1983.<ref name="Kioa">{{cite book |last1= G. M.

Kioa is one of two islands in Fiji populated by migrant communities from the [[Pacific Islands]], the other being [[Rabi Island|Rabi]], also in the [[Vanua Levu Group]] and home to a displaced [[Banaba Island|Banaban]] community. Early in 2005, the Fijian government decided to grant full citizenship to the Kioa and Rabi Islanders.  As a culmination of a decade-long quest for naturalization, a formal ceremony was held on 15 December 2005 to award 566 citizenship certificates to residents of the islands and their descendants (some of whom now live elsewhere in Fiji), which entitles them to provincial and national assistance for rural development.  The ceremony was led by [[Cabinet of Fiji|Cabinet Ministers]] [[Josefa Vosanibola]] and [[Naiqama Lalabalavu|Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu]], who is also the ''[[Tui Cakau]]'', or Paramount Chief of [[Cakaudrove]], which includes the island of Kioa.

Lalabalavu called on the Kioa islanders to be proud of their identity and to nurture and protect their culture.

Although part of [[Cakaudrove Province|Cakaudrove]] [[Local government in Fiji|Province]], the island has a degree of [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]] with its own administrative body, the [[Kioa Island Council]], although the Fijian [[Cabinet of Fiji|Cabinet]] decided on 15 January 2006 to merge it with the [[Rabi Council of Leaders|Rabi Island Council]].

The island environment contributes to its national significance as outlined in Fiji's Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ganilau|first1=Bernadette Rounds|title=Fiji Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan|date=2007|publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity|pages=107â€“112|url=https://www.cbd.int/doc/world/fj/fj-nbsap-01-en.pdf|accessdate=28 May 2017}}</ref>

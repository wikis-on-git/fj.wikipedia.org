The '''Solar System''' is the [[bibi|gravitationally]] bound system of the [[Matanisiga|Sun]] and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the remainder being smaller objects, the [[dwarf veivuravura|dwarf planets]] and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly—the [[Setilaiti dina|moons]]—two are larger than the smallest planet, [[Mercury]].
The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the [[idre kabebe|gravitational collapse]] of a giant interstellar [[molecular o|molecular cloud]]. The vast majority of the system's [[Na|mass]] is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained in [[Jupiter]]. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, [[Venus]], [[Vuravura (Veivuravura)|Earth]] and [[Mars]], are [[vakateresitieli veivuravura |terrestrial planets]], being primarily composed of [[vatu|rock]] and [kaukamea[|metal]]. The four outer planets are [[giant planets]], being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and [[Saturn]], are [[gas giants]], being composed mainly of [[hydrogen]] and [[eliumi|helium]]; the two outermost planets, [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]], are [[Aisi tuwawa|ice giants]], being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called [[volatiles]], such as [[wai|water]], [[ammonia]] and [[methane]]. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the [[ecliptic]]. 
The Solar System also contains smaller objects. The [[asteroid beleti|asteroid belt]], which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and metal. Beyond Neptune's orbit lie the [[Kuiper beleti|Kuiper belt]] and [[veiseyaki Disi|scattered disc]], which are populations of [[iVakadewa-Neptunian iyaya|trans-Neptunian objects]] composed mostly of ices, and beyond them a newly discovered population of [[sednoid|sednoids]]. Within these populations, some objects are large enough to have rounded under their own gravity, though there is considerable debate as to how many there will prove to be. Such objects are categorized as dwarf planets. Identified or accepted dwarf planets include the asteroid [[Ceres]] and the trans-Neptunian objects [[Pluto]] and [[Eris]]. In addition to these two regions, various other small-body populations, including [[comet|comets]], [[centaur|centaurs]] and interplanetary [[dust clouds]], freely travel between regions. Six of the planets, the six largest possible dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites, usually termed "moons" after the Moon. Each of the outer planets is encircled by [[veivuravura mama|planetary rings]] of dust and other small objects.

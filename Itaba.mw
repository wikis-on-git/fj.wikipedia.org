Na '''itaba''' is an [[Optics|optical]] instrument used to capture an [[image]]. At their most basic, cameras are sealed boxes (the camera body) with a small hole (the [[aperture]]) that allow light in to capture an image on a light-sensitive surface (usually [[photographic film]] or a [[digital sensor]]). Cameras have various mechanisms to control how the light falls onto the light-sensitive surface. [[Lens|Lenses]] focus the light entering the camera, the size of the aperture can be widened or narrowed to let more or less light into the camera, and a [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]] mechanism determines the amount of time the photo-sensitive surface is exposed to the light.

The still image camera is the main instrument in the art of photography and captured images may be reproduced later as a part of the process of photography, [[digital imaging]], [[photographic printing]]. The similar artistic fields in the moving image camera domain are film, [[videography]], and [[cinematography]].

The word ''camera'' comes from ''[[camera obscura]]'', which means "dark chamber" and is the Latin name of the original device for projecting an image of external reality onto a flat surface. The modern photographic camera evolved from the camera obscura. The functioning of the camera is very similar to the functioning of the human eye. The first permanent photograph was made in 1825 by [[Nicéphore Niépce|Joseph Nicéphore Niépce]].

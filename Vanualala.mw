'''Vanualala''' is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which [[Physical body|objects]] and events have relative [[position (geometry)|position]] and [[direction (geometry)|direction]]. Physical space is often conceived in three [[linear]] [[dimension]]s, although modern [[physics|physicists]] usually consider it, with [[time]], to be part of a boundless four-dimensional [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] known as [[spacetime]]. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical [[universe]]. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a [[conceptual framework]].

== Geology ==
Fiji lies in a [[plate tectonics|tectonically complex area]] between the [[Australian Plate]] and the [[Pacific Plate]]. The Fiji Platform lies in a zone bordered with active extension fault lines around which most of the shallow earthquakes were centered. These fault lines are the Fiji Fracture Zone (FFZ) to the north, the [[Spreading ridge|176° Extension Zone]] (176°E EZ) to the west, and the Hunter Fracture Zone (HFZ) and Lau Ridge to the east.<ref name="Greenbaum">{{cite web|url=http://eird.org/deslizamientos/pdf/eng/doc8455/doc8455-2a.pdf|title=Landslide hazards in Fiji|last=Greenbaum|first=D.|author2=Bowker, M.

The Group forms the Korotini Tableland in the middle of the island, it includes the peaks of Seseleka ({{convert|1380|ft|sp=us|disp=or}}), Ndelanathau ({{convert|2443|ft|sp=us|disp=or}}), Nararo ({{convert|2420|ft|sp=us|disp=or}}), Valili ({{convert|2965|ft|sp=us|disp=or}}), Mariko ({{convert|2890|ft|sp=us|disp=or}}), [[Mount Nasorolevu]] ({{convert|3386|ft|sp=us|disp=or}}), Ndikeva ({{convert|3139|ft|sp=us|disp=or}}), and Uluingala ({{convert|2730|ft|sp=us|disp=or}}). The Pliocene Undu Group in the northeastern portion of the island, consists of [[breccia]], [[tuff]], and flows of [[rhyolite]] and [[dacite]] overlain by [[pumice]]ous [[strata]]. The Plio-[[Pleistocene]] Mba Grouop is found on the southwestern portion of the island and consists of [[porphyritic]] basalt flows and volcanoclastics grading into [[greywacke]]. The Group includes the peak of Navotuvotu ({{convert|2763|ft|sp=us|disp=or}}) and the Mt. Kasi Mine.<ref>{{cite book |title=Provisional Geologic Map of Fiji |date=1965 |publisher=Fiji Geological Survey |location=Suva}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rodda |first1=P. |title=Outline of the geology of Viti Levu |journal=New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics |date=1967 |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=1260–1273 |doi=10.1080/00288306.1967.10420217|doi-access=free }}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:2004.03.04 08 Vanua Levu ferry Fiji.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Island of Vanua Levu]]

The main part of the island is roughly shaped like a tall, thin triangle {{convert|30|to(-)|50|km|mi|abbr=off}} in width and {{convert|180|km|mi|abbr=off}} in length, rotated so that the point is to the northeast. This point, the northernmost in the Fiji chain, is [[Udu Point]]. From the southeastern side of this triangle, a long [[peninsula]] stretches out into the [[Koro Sea]]. The island is rough and hilly, and is surrounded by coral reefs, including [[Cakaulevu Reef]], a long barrier reef off the northern shore. The [[antimeridian]] passes through this island.

A rugged mountain range divides the island horizontally, forming much of the boundary between the [[Local government in Fiji|Provinces]] of [[Cakaudrove Province|Cakaudrove]] and [[Macuata Province|Macuata]]. The highest peaks are Mount Batini, also known as [[Nasorolevu]], with an altitude of {{convert|1,111|m|ft|abbr=off}}, and, {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=off}} further north-east, [[Dikeva]], also known as Mount Thurston, with an altitude of {{convert|1,030|m|ft|abbr=off}}. Vanua Levu's main mountain ranges lie near the windward, southern coasts, making them much wetter. Northern Vanua Levu, by contrast, has a dry climate eight months of the year, enabling [[sugar cane]], the island's major [[crop]], to thrive there. Vanua Levu has a number of rivers, including the [[Labasa River|Labasa]], the [[Wailevu River|Wailevu]], and the [[Qawa River|Qawa]]. These three form a [[river delta|delta]] on which the town of [[Labasa]] stands. None of the island's rivers are navigable by large vessels. There are also many well known rivers on Vanua levu. The first is the most dangerous river, the Wainikoro river, known for its shark attacks. The second is the Dreketi river, the deepest river in Fiji.

== Flora and fauna ==

A {{convert|17600|ha|acre}} area covering much of the interior of the Natewa/Tunuloa peninsula is the Natewa/Tunuloa Peninsula [[Important Bird Area]]. The [[Important Bird Area]] covers the largest tracts of remaining old growth forest on the peninsula, which is on the south of Vanua Levu, and it supports a population of [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] [[Tongan ground dove|Shy Ground-dove]].<ref>{{cite web|title=BirdLife Data Zone: Natewa/Tunuloa Peninsula|url=http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/factsheet/natewa-tunuloa-peninsula-iba-fiji|website=datazone.birdlife.org|accessdate=30 May 2017}}</ref>

== Demographics and economic activities ==

The island's main population centres are the towns of Labasa, in the north, and [[Savusavu]], located at the foot of the peninsula. Labasa, with a population of almost 25,000 at the 1996 [[census]], has a large Indian community, and is a major centre of Fiji's sugar industry. Savusavu is smaller, with a population of just under 5000, but is a popular centre for [[tourist]]s owing to its [[Underwater diving|diving]] and [[yacht]]ing facilities. The main industry on the island is sugar cane production, especially in the north. Copra is also an important crop. Tourism is now becoming a major industry on Vanua Levu also.

== Politics ==
For administrative purposes, Vanua Levu is divided into three Provinces: [[Bua Province|Bua]] (in the west), Macuata (in the north-east), and Cakaudrove (in the south-east). These three provinces also comprise the [[Northern Division, Fiji|Northern Division]] of Fiji. Together with the remote [[Lau Islands]], Vanua Levu and its outliers form the [[Tovata|Tovata Confederacy]], one of three traditional alliances of Fiji's chiefs. The Paramount Chief, who is based on the nearby island of [[Taveuni]], holds the title of ''[[Tui Cakau]].'' Only two population centres - [[Labasa]] and [[Savusavu]] - have been incorporated as [[Town]]s. Each is governed by a [[Mayor]] and a [[Town Council]], whose members are elected for a three-year term and choose the Mayor from among themselves. At present, normative local body governance is in abeyance, and all cities and towns in Fiji are being run temporarily by Special Administrators appointed by the central government.

Vanua Levu was settled about 3,100 years ago, with the settlers living in houses raised above the reefs on the shores. Between 1250 and 1350 the Pacific sea level fell {{Convert|30|cm|in|abbr=}}, exposing the tops of the reefs. This killed the abundant sea food, it also dropped the ground water table below the depth of the roots of the crops. The scarcity of food caused conflict and war. In response, the people moved from seaside villages, for mountaintop fortified villages. This forts were occupied until about 1870, with the last clear indication of warfare about 1860.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2016/06/fiji_s_experience_with_sea_level_rise_600_years_ago_shows_how_climate_change.html |title=Fiji's experience with sea-level rise 600 years ago shows how climate change can inspire violence. |newspaper=Slate.com |date=June 21, 2016 |author=Patrick Nunn |accessdate=August 11, 2016}}</ref>

The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] navigator [[Abel Tasman]] was the first known [[European ethnic groups|European]] to sight Vanua Levu, in 1643. He was followed by [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] [[William Bligh]] in 1789, en route to [[Timor]] while escaping from the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]], in which his crew had forced him and those loyal to him off deck and cast them adrift in a lifeboat. Captain [[James Wilson (Captain)|James Wilson]] subsequently explored the area in 1797 in his ship [[DFuff (1794 ship)|''Duff'']].

Traders began exploiting [[sandalwood]] thickets in the [[Bua Bay]] area around 1805, which had been discovered by shipwrecked sailors of the schooner [[Argo (1800)|''Argo'']].<ref>{{cite book | title=Islands and Empires: Western Impact on the Pacific and East Asia | publisher=University of Minnesota Press | author=Dodge, Earnest S. | year=1976 | location=Minneapolis | pages=[https://archive.org/details/islandsempireswe0000dodg/page/62 62]–63 | url = https://archive.org/details/islandsempireswe0000dodg | url-access=registration | quote=argo schooner fiji. | isbn=978-0-8166-0853-9}}</ref> By 1815, however, the supply had been depleted and apart from the occasional visit from [[whaling|whalers]] and [[Sea cucumber (food)|bêche-de-mer]] traders, the island received little further attention until 1840, when a young sailor known as Jackson <!--Does anybody known his first name?--> deserted his crew at [[Somosomo]] on the nearby island of Taveuni, was adopted by a local [[Ratu|Chief]], and explored much of eastern and northern Vanua Levu.

Settlers from [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] established [[coconut]] plantations in the Savusavu area in the 1860s. Intermarriage with [[Fijians|Fijian people]] produced a mixed-race elite, which also prospered from the sale of [[copra]], of which Savusavu was a major centre, until the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s led to a collapse in the price of copra. In the same period, [[India]]ns founded the town of [[Labasa, Fiji|Labasa]], now a major [[sugar]]-producing centre.

In 2012, the nation of [[Kiribati]] began negotiating to buy {{convert|5000|acres|0|abbr=off}} of the island to house its population, which is expected to need to move as their islands are inundated by [[Current sea level rise|rising sea levels]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/kiribati/9127576/Entire-nation-of-Kiribati-to-be-relocated-over-rising-sea-level-threat.html|title=Entire nation of Kiribati to be relocated over rising sea level threat|author=Paul Chapman|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2012-03-07|accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref>

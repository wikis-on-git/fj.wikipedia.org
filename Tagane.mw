Na '''tagane''' (â™‚) [[bula]] is the [[physiological]] [[sex]] that produces [[sperm]]. Each [[spermatozoon]] can fuse with a larger [[female]] gamete, or [[ovum]], in the process of [[fertilization]]. A male cannot [[sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]] without access to at least one ovum from a female, but some organisms can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most male [[mammal]]s, including male humans, have a [[Y chromosome]], which codes for the production of larger amounts of [[testosterone]] to develop [[male reproductive organs]].

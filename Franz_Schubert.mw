'''Franz Peter Schubert''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfʁant͡s ˈpeːtɐ ˈʃuːbɐt|lang}}; 31 January 1797 - 19 November 1828) was an Austrian composer of the late [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and early [[Romantic music|Romantic]] eras. Despite his short lifetime, Schubert left behind a vast oeuvre, including more than 600 [[Secular music|secular]] vocal works (mainly [[lied]]er), seven complete [[symphonies]], [[sacred music]], [[opera]]s, [[incidental music]] and a large body of piano and [[chamber music]]. His major works include the [[Trout Quintet|Piano Quintet in A major, D. 667 (''Trout Quintet'')]], the [[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|Symphony No. 8 in B minor, D. 759 (''Unfinished Symphony'')]], the [[Symphony No. 9 (Schubert)|”Great” Symphony No. 9 in C major, D. 944]], the [[String Quintet (Schubert)|String Quintet]] (D. 956), the [[Schubert's last sonatas|three last piano sonatas]] (D. 958–960), the opera ''[[Fierrabras (opera)|Fierrabras]]'' (D. 796), the incidental music to the play ''[[Rosamunde]]'' (D. 797), and the song cycles ''[[Die schöne Müllerin]]'' (D. 795) and ''[[Winterreise]]'' (D. 911).

Born in the Himmelpfortgrund suburb of [[Vienna]], Schubert showed uncommon gifts for music from an early age. His father gave him his first violin lessons and his elder brother gave him piano lessons, but Schubert soon exceeded their abilities. In 1808, at the age of eleven, he became a pupil at the Stadtkonvikt school, where he became acquainted with the orchestral music of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]. He left the Stadtkonvikt at the end of 1813, and returned home to live with his father, where he began studying to become a schoolteacher. Despite this, he continued his studies in composition with [[Antonio Salieri]] and still composed prolifically. In 1821, Schubert was admitted to the [[Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde]] as a performing member, which helped establish his name among the Viennese citizenry. He gave a concert of his own works to critical acclaim in March 1828, the only time he did so in his career. He died eight months later at the age of 31, the cause officially attributed to [[typhoid fever]], but believed by some historians to be [[syphilis]].

Appreciation of Schubert's music while he was alive was limited to a relatively small circle of admirers in Vienna, but interest in his work increased greatly in the decades following his death. [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Johannes Brahms]] and other 19th-century composers discovered and championed his works. Today, Schubert is ranked among the greatest composers of Western classical music and his music continues to be popular.

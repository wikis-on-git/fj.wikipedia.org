In [[mathematics]], '''division by zero''' is [[division (mathematics)|division]] where the divisor (denominator) is [[0 (number)|zero]]. Such a division can be formally [[expression (mathematics)|expressed]] as {{sfrac|''a''|0}} where ''a'' is the dividend (numerator). In ordinary arithmetic, the expression has no meaning, as there is no number which, when multiplied by 0, gives ''a'' (assuming ''a''&nbsp;â‰ &nbsp;0), and so division by zero is [[undefined (mathematics)|undefined]].

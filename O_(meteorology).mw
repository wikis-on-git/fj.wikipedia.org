Ena '''[[meteorology]]''', a '''O''' is an [[aerosol]] consisting of a visible mass of minute [[liquid]] [[drop (liquid)|droplets]], [[ice crystals|frozen crystals]], or other [[particulates|particles]] suspended in the [[atmosphere]] of a [[planet]]ary body or similar space.<ref>{{cite web |title=Weather Terms |url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/box/glossary.htm |publisher=[[National Weather Service]] |accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref> [[Water]] or various other chemicals may compose the droplets and crystals. On [[Earth]], clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its [[dew point]], or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of [[water vapor]]) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature.

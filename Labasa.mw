'''Labasa''' na [[siti]] mai [[Viti]].

== Economic activities ==
The surrounding areas of Labasa are mostly farming areas, which contribute to much of the industry in the town. The largest crop grown is sugar cane. The large Fiji Sugar Corporation sugar mill in Labasa town is the only such mill on the island.

Recently, due to political changes and loss of overseas markets, sugar cane farming and production has been steadily decreasing. This has been reflected in the increasing migration of people to the main island of Viti Levu, in search of employment opportunities.

Labasa Hospital is the referral center for all health centers and hospital on the island of Vanua Levu, and has recently been expanded.

Labasa is generally an agricultural town, off the tourist track. Labasa now has a couple of good hotels to stay in (Takia/Travel Lodge and Grand Eastern Hotel). There is at least one good movie theatre and several good restaurants in the main street providing a range of local and Chinese flavours.

There is a fairly large market towards the end of the town where one can buy and sample a range of foods, spices, fish, poultry, goats and other local products. A large taxi stand and a bus stop is also by the market.

It also has some popular tourist spots while the people of Labasa are quite well known for their hospitality.<sup>[''citation needed'']</sup>

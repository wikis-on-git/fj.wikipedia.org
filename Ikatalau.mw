In the contemporary UK and Ireland, a weekday breakfast may involve a cereal dish, such as muesli, [[porridge]] or cereal, or [[toast]] or simply bread spread with [[jam]] or [[marmalade]]. Tea and coffee remain equally popular accompaniments. Marmalade, originally a Portuguese confection, had been a popular British spread to consume in the evening, before the Scots moved it to the breakfast table in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/19/1061261128384.html|title=Spread over centuries|date=10 June 2015|agency=The Age|issue=19 August 2003}}</ref> It is however becoming very common to 'skip breakfast' entirely or take coffee or pastries on the morning commute. Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.

The traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The "full Scottish breakfast" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]]. Originating in the British isles during the [[Victorian era]], the full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History|last=Spencer|first=Colin|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0}}</ref>

Another traditional British breakfast consists of [[porridge]], although now associated with Scotland, it has been consumed across Britain as a staple food since at least the [[Middle Ages]]. The breakfast cereal [[Scott's Porage Oats]] was produced in [[Glasgow]] in 1880.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottsporage.co.uk/the-scotts-porage-story/our-heritage/#1|title=Scott's Porage – Our Heritage|publisher=Scott's Porage Oats|accessdate=19 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923232409/http://www.scottsporage.co.uk/the-scotts-porage-story/our-heritage/#1|archive-date=23 September 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Before the arrival of American-style breakfast cereals in the early 20th century, dried bread soaked in hot milk or tea and porridge (boiled oats) was the common daily breakfast, while leftover vegetables (often, cabbage) and potatoes not eaten the night before were often served re-fried becoming '[[bubble and squeak|bubble-and-squeak]]';<ref name="ReferenceB">Caroline Conran, Traditional Cooking (British Cookery)1978 {{ISBN|0233 97053 3}}</ref> in [[Ireland]] the dish is known as [[colcannon]]. Traditionally, breakfast would be served with a small amount of fruit, such as a slice of orange, believed to prevent the onset of [[scurvy]].<ref>Dr E. J. C. Kendall, (1955) Scurvy during some British polar expeditions, 1875–1917 ''[[Polar Record]]'', 7, pp. 467–85</ref> Also traditional, but now less popular breakfasts included fish in the form of [[kippers]] (smoked [[herring]]) with poached egg and toast, and [[kedgeree]] (a Scoto-Indian smoked [[haddock]], egg, and rice dish originating in [[Colonial India]]). Most British breakfasts are consumed with tea, [[coffee]], or [[fruit juice]].<ref name="ReferenceB" />

Na '''iyaloyalo''', also called a '''movie''', '''motion picture''' or '''moving picture''', is a work of [[visual art]] used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through the use of moving images. These images are generally accompanied by sound, and more rarely, other sensory stimulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tribecafilm.com/future-of-film/future-of-the-movie-theater-is-in-your-mind|title=The Movie Theater of the Future Will Be In Your Mind|last=Severny|first=Andrei|date=2013-09-05|work=[[Tribeca Film Festival|Tribeca]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907214603/http://tribecafilm.com/future-of-film/future-of-the-movie-theater-is-in-your-mind|archive-date=September 7, 2013|url-status=dead|access-date=September 5, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The word "'''cinema'''", short for [[cinematography]], is often used to refer to [[filmmaking]] and the [[film industry]], and to the [[art]] form that is the result of it.

The moving images of a film are created by [[photography|photographing]] actual scenes with a [[movie camera|motion-picture camera]], by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional [[animation]] techniques, by means of [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] and [[computer animation]], or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other [[visual effects]].

Traditionally, films were recorded onto celluloid [[film stock]] through a [[Photographic film|photochemical]] process and then shown through a [[movie projector]] onto a large [[Projection screen|screen]]. Contemporary films are often [[Digital recording|fully digital]] <!--video, because it is electronic--> through the entire process of production, distribution, and exhibition, while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous [[sound-on-film|optical soundtrack]] (a graphic [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] of the spoken words, music and other [[sound]]s that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it, and is not projected).

Films are [[cultural artifact]]s created by specific [[culture]]s. They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important art form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for [[documentary film|educating]]—or [[propaganda film|indoctrinating]]—citizens. The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] or [[subtitles]] to [[translation|translate]] the dialog into other languages.

The individual images that make up a film are called [[Film frame|frames]]. In the projection of [[tradition]]al celluloid films, a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame, in turn, is moved into position to be projected, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as [[persistence of vision]], whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after its source disappears. The perception of motion is partly due to a psychological effect called the [[phi phenomenon]].
